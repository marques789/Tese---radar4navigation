\section{Summary}


In this chapter we presented the proposed architecture intended to carry out person tracking missions using \ac{UAV}s.  
The proposed solution is comprised of multiple software and hardware modules deployed in the drone side and the ground side. These modules interact with each other in order to carry out the tracking mission.
Once implemented, the proposed architecture aims to be able to perform \ac{UAV} tracking missions with persons as targets without user inputs.
