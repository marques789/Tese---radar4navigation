\section{Introduction}

\section{Hardware}
Has said before the robotic platform used in this work is the turtlebot2. The out of the box platform was modified in order to include a processing unit, a lidar and a \ac{FMCW} radar as sensors. The modified version is displayed in figure X.  The chosen \ac{FMCW} radar board is the Texas Instruments mmwave AWR1642BOOST.

The radar board chosen for this work is TI's AWR1642BOOST (Fig.\ref{fig:awr}). It will be used as an obstacle detector.\\

\section{Software}
The software used in this project is divided in three stages. First one is the interface between the radar board TLV data and the ROS message format. Then a filtering operation to remove false detections.
