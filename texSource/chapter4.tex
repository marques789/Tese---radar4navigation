\section{Introduction}

This chapter describes some of the challenges and limitations faced by the architecture proposed in the previous chapter and the control choices that were implemented to deal with them.
Section \ref{ch:calibration} shows the method used to derive an  estimate of the distance from the target, person, to the active \ac{UAV}.
