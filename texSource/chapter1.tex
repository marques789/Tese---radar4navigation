%This chapter describes the motivations for this dissertation, followed by its objectives. The contributions done during this dissertation are also presented, along with a succinct description of the documents structure.

%The \ac{VANET} that was used present in his architecture different entities: an \ac{LMA} which is responsible for managing the \ac{VANET}, and also to store information about the overall network status; and the \ac{RSU}s and \ac{OBU}s are also real systems that are called NetRiders - single board computers containing \ac{WAVE}, \ac{WiFi}, \ac{GPS}, and cellular interfaces. This \ac{VANET} is capable of \ac{MH} where it sends the traffic through the different technologies available resulting in a better load balancing, this load balancing mechanism feature is integrated at the \ac{LMA} which is responsible to optimize the traffic division having in mind the different technologies and throughput available for each \ac{PoA}. This \ac{VANET} is also capable of performing \ac{NC} to provide loss reduction, where the encoding is done at the \ac{RSU}s level, where the packets will be encoded through the wireless communications between the \ac{RSU}s and the \ac{OBU}s.
