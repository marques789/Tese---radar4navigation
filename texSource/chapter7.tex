\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}


\section{Conclusion}
In this work we it was examined in detail how the \ac{FMCW} \ac{radar} and \ac{LiDAR} technology work and how they are used for certain applications. After this, it was implemented a robotic navigation platform \textbf{turtlebot2} using \ac{ROS} and \ac{TI} \ac{mmWave} devices 2D-\ac{LiDAR} that is ready to use for indoor navigation tasks.
